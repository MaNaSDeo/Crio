I'm teying to learn GIT.
This to check use case of git status.

we can do
    1. "git add ." --> to add all the file  that I had changed in the current folder.
    2. can use "git add first.txt" to add this file only from the current folder.

Now successfully commited.
Trying to know what will happen when I will make a change in the same file.
